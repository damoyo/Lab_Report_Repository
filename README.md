# About LRR

LRR (Lab Report Repository) is an online software application for course instructors to post, receive and mark assignments, and for students to submit assignments, or submit re-marking requests.

This software was originally developed by Mahomed Nor in 2018, a graduate student in the Department of Computer Science at the Zhejiang Normal University,
while he was taking a graduate course called **Advanced Software Engineering** (http://lanlab.org/course/2018f/se/homepage.html).

The LRR's project home page is at http://121.4.94.30/homepage/.  For potential project contributors, we recommend that you browse its home page first to familiarize yourself  with the project.



# Mission

Our mission is to make the experience of submitting assignments great for tens of hundreds of students in the department of computer science at the Zhejiang Normal University.



# Installation Instructions


## Hui's steps

I spent about two hours installing LRR to a bare, remote Ubuntu server (Ubuntu 20.04 LTS).

LRR needs Apache and MySQL to run.  I followed [How To Install Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP (LAMP) stack on Ubuntu 20.04](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-linux-apache-mysql-php-lamp-stack-on-ubuntu-20-04) to set up these server applications.

LRR uses a database called `lrr`.  I need to export the existing `lrr` to a plain text file (including many sql commands) and import that text file to the newly created `lrr` database on the new server.
The command for exporting the database is `mysqldump -u mnc -p lrr > lrr_database_dump.txt`.
The command for importing is `mysql -u mnc -p lrr < lrr_database_dump.txt`.  Read [How to Import and Export MySQL Databases in Linux](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/import-and-export-mysql-database) for more detail.

LRR also needs to store assignment submissions.  We store them in a folder called `../../lrr_submission`.  Note that `lrr_submission` is two levels above the project folder (where many PHP files reside).  I copied this folder from the existing one.  I think it is also OK if you create an empty folder.   
We need to set a proper owner and accessibility for `lrr_submission` using the following two commands:
`sudo chown -R www-data:www-data lrr_submission` and  `sudo chmod -R g+rw lrr_submission`.  Also, remember to change the user name and password in `lrr_submission/KeepItSafe.txt` for the database connection.

The above steps are preparation work. Now we could clone the LRR's repository to `/var/www/html/`.
Rename LRR to lrr.  Change the owner of lrr: `sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /var/www/lrr`. Edit apache configure file: `sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/lrr.conf`.


    <VirtualHost *:80>
        ServerName lrr
        ServerAlias www.lrr.com
        ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
        DocumentRoot /var/www/html/lrr
        ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
        CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined
    </VirtualHost>

Enable the site lrr: `sudo a2ensite lrr`.  Restart the apache server: `sudo systemctl reload apache2`.
Visit the LRR application by entering this URL in a web browser: http://121.4.94.30/.


## Enock's steps

Enock, a graduate student here, has made a tutorial about how he deployed LRR to a remote server (http://lanlab.org/course/2021s/spm/PuTTY-Server.txt).




# Current Status

This software has been actively used by students who took or are
taking courses taught by Hui, e.g., Introduction to Software
Engineering, Introduction to Object-oriented analysis and design,
Advanced Software Engineering, Software Architecture, and Software
Project Management.

There are more than 500 student accounts created since its first
launch in 2018.

A running instance of this software is at http://118.25.96.118/nor/

There are about 40 bugs (most being CRITICAL) that remain unresolved
before LRR can hit its Beta release.  See the section *The Bug
Tracker* for more detail.  Currently, there are a few students who are
taking my Advanced Software Engineering course) working on these bugs.



# The Bug Tracker

We use Bugzilla to track LRR's bugs and feature requests.

Most bugs are [recorded on Bugzilla](http://118.25.96.118/bugzilla/buglist.cgi?bug_status=__all__&list_id=1319&order=Importance&product=Lab%20Report%20Repository%20%28nor%20houzi%29&query_format=specific).



# TODO

-  [Priority low] *Receiving email for password resetting*. Password resetting link is not always sent successfully.

-  [Priority medium] *Discuss how assignments should be stored?* `/student-number/course-code/semester/section-number/assignement-title/submission.txt`

-  [SOLVED] Editing the assignment title after uploading a new assignment (instructor).

-  [SOLVED] A new user could not login immediately after sign up.

- A more complete list of TODO's is at http://lanlab.org/course/2020s/spm/decide-areas-for-improvement-review.html


# How to Contribute

We welcome your participation in this project.

Your participation does not have to be in the form of contributing code.  You could help us on
ideas, suggestions, documentation, etc.

You can fork this project and start working on your fork.  After you are done, please create a pull request so that we could review your changes and give you feedback.

You will use the feature-branching workflow (see below).
The main point of this workflow is
that you work on a branch on your local drive, push that branch to a remote
repository, and create a Pull Request (i.e., Pull Me Request) at
for other people to review your changes.  If everything is
OK, then *someone* could merge your changes to the master branch in the
central repository.

I believe that *code review* at the Pull Request stage is important
for both improving code quality and improving team quality.



## The Feature-branching Workflow

We will use the feature-branching workflow for collaboration.  The
idea is that you make your own branch, work on it, and push this branch to
the remote, online repository for code review.

Check the section **The feature-branching workflow** in the following link for more detail:

https://github.com/spm2020spring/TeamCollaborationTutorial/blob/master/team.rst


## Testing

Make sure your changes can pass all the tests in folder [./test](http://121.4.94.30:3000/mrlan/LRR/src/branch/master/test).


## Communications Method

To submit bug reports or improvement ideas, please contact Hui [lanhui at zjnu.edu.cn].  He could open a Bugzilla account for you.

We can also communicate through pull requests.  You make a pull request, I review it and comment on it, and you revise your pull request until everyone is happy so that your changes get merged to the master branch.



## Frequently Asked Questions


1. Q: The web application's front page does not show properly, i.e., elements are not well aligned. 
   A: You missed two folders `css` and `font-awesome`.  These folders include third-party js or css files and therefore are not included.

1. Q: What if I do not have any information about the `lrr` database?
   A: You could use `lrr_database.sql` to make a new database.
